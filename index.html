        We attack the mayor with hummus. I hate to bring up our imminent arrest during your crazy time, but we gotta move. Ah, the pitter patter of tiny feet in huge combat boots. And what's with all the carrots? If every vampire who said he was at the crucifixion actually was there, it would've been like Woodstock. We will bring you the limp and beaten body of Bob Barker! I mean, officially I deplore violence, but that was totally worth the loss of karma points! Bonnie and Clyde, they wanted fame, notoriety, and boy did they get it. They also got dead. They need to take seven and they might take yours. These endless days are finally ending in a blaze.

        You shut the hell up right now or so help me, I'll shut you up. I'm not planning on presiding over the end of Western Civilization. We're old friends from Navy. Friends from Old Navy. I worked retail, he'd come in, buy slacks How did you find me here? You're gonna die screaming but you won't be heard. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. And that'd be where you find stored such things as empathy, compassion, an aversion to disemboweling puppies.

        From beneath you, it devours. I am never gonna see a merman, ever. And that'd be where you find stored such things as empathy, compassion, an aversion to disemboweling puppies. Well, I'm sure I'm in serious need of some moral spankitude, but guess who's not qualified to be my Rabbi? If I could make you purtier, I would. You're a hell of a woman. Well, I haven't been to a hell dimension just of late, but I do know a thing or two about torment. You can't take the sky from me.
